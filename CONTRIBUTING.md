# Contributing

All contributions are welcome. You can help by reporting bugs, providing captured usb communication (look at doc/README.md for further information) or opening pull requests.

The following list contains features that i can not implement without your help (because i don't have the required hardware), capturing usb data and testing is needed. Please open an issue if you want to contribute.
- Remapping the keys on ISO-layout keyboards and the Ajazz AK33
- Setting the variant of the reactive color led mode on the Ajazz AK33
- Reading the stored settings on the Ajazz AK33
